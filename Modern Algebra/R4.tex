\subsection{Ideals}
Previously, in group theory, we used normal subgroups to construct quotient groups. We now seek to develop analogous conditions for subrings to construct quotient rings. Recall that we may partition a ring through individual cosets that are \textit{equivalence classes} of the form
\begin{equation*}
	r+S = \set{r+s : s \in S}
\end{equation*}
If we define these to be the exact elements of a quotient ring $R/S$ we must have that 
\begin{align*}
	(r_1 + S)(r_2+S) &\in R/S \\
	(r_1+S)+(r_2+S) &\in R/S
\end{align*}
The second equation implies that $S$ must be closed under addition. The first equation implies that we must have
\begin{align*}
	(r_1+s)(r_2+s') &\in ab+S \\
	r_1r_2+r_1s'+sr_2+ss' & \in r_1r_2 + S
\end{align*}
Notice that $ss'$ is already in $S$ and $r_1r_2$ cancels out. This leaves us with
\begin{equation*}
	r_1s'+sr_2 \in S \imp r_1s' \in S \text{ and } sr_2 \in S
\end{equation*}
which describes the exact conditions needed for $S$ to be used to form a quotient ring.
\begin{definition}
	Let $R$ be a ring. A subset $I \subseteq R$ is called an \textbf{ideal} if:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*)]
		\item $I$ is closed under addition;
		\item for all $r \in R$ and $i \in I$, we have
		\[
		ri \in I \quad \text{and} \quad ir \in I.
		\]
	\end{enumerate}
	An ideal $I$ is called \textbf{proper} if $I \neq R$ (equivalently, $1 \notin I$). The ideal is considered to be \textbf{principal} if there exists $a \in R$ such that
	\begin{equation*}
		I = (a):= \set{ra: r \in R}
	\end{equation*}
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
	A commutative ring $R$ is a field if and only if it has no proper ideals.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	$(\Rightarrow)$ If $R$ is a field, then every nonzero element is a unit.
	Thus any ideal containing a nonzero element must contain $1$, and hence must equal $R$.
	
	$(\Leftarrow)$ If $R$ has no proper ideals and $a \neq 0$, then $(a) = R$.
	Thus $1 \in (a)$, so there exists $b \in R$ with $ba = 1$, showing that $a$ is a unit.
	Hence $R$ is a field.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Quotient Rings}

\begin{definition}
	Let $R$ be a ring and let $I \unlhd R$ be an ideal. The \textbf{quotient ring}
	(or \textbf{factor ring}) $R/I$ is the set
	\[
	R/I := \{ r + I : r \in R \},
	\]
	with addition and multiplication defined by
	\[
	(r+I)+(s+I)=(r+s)+I,
	\qquad
	(r+I)(s+I)=rs+I.
	\]
\end{definition}
The formation of the quotient ring allows us to simplify structures of rings to analyze similarities and differences. Each element of the quotient ring represents shifted versions of the given ideal $I$. Once the quotient is formed, all elements of $I$ collapse to 0.

\begin{eg}
Let $R = \mathbb{R}[x]$.

The ideal generated by $x^2+1$ is
\[
(x^2+1) = \{(x^2+1)f(x) : f(x)\in \mathbb{R}[x]\}.
\]

The quotient ring
\[
\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2+1)
\]
satisfies the relation $x^2 = -1$ and is isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$.
\end{eg}
